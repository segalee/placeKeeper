//  <!-- Here we will use a <form> to get the user settings and save them to
//  localStorage.
//  The application should use the colors provided by the user and show the
//  pages accordingly.
//  Step 1 - Colors
//  Use HTML5 color <input> to let the user set its background and text color of the
//  pages.
//  TIP: use: userService.save(userData)
//  Step 2 – Date and Time
//  Use HTML5 date and time <input>s to let the user set his exact birth time, In the
//  hompage render how many hours to his next (accurate) birthday
//  Step 3 – Wrap in a form
//  Put those inputs in a <form>, and when submit, use a service to keep them in a
//  localstorage object: userData
//  TIP: you will need event.preventDefault in the onsubmit event handler.
//  Step 4 – Add some more inputs
//  • Add a required email <input>
//  • Add a range <input> to let the user select his age: 18->120
//   -->
